For Arctic Realms Special Survival Features, consider looking at the feature updates

## Skyblock

Skyblock is a challenging gamemode where you start on a small island in the sky with limited resources. You have to expand your island, complete challenges, and unlock new features. You can also visit other islands, trade with other players, or join a co-op with your friends.

## Bedwars

Bedwars is a popular team-based gamemode where you have to protect your bed and destroy the enemy's bed. You can collect resources from generators, buy items from shops, and use various strategies to win. You can play solo, with a partner, or with a team of up to four players.

## Practice PvP

Practice PvP is a gamemode where you can hone your skills in various PvP scenarios, such as duels, team fights, or free-for-all. You can choose from different kits, arenas, and settings to customize your experience. You can also track your stats and rank up on the leaderboards.

We also have PvP bots, which you can play with to improve your PvP skills. You can select the difficulty level and the number of bots to challenge yourself.

## Creative

Creative is a gamemode where you can unleash your imagination and build anything you want with unlimited blocks and tools. You can claim your own plot of land and use world editing plugins, such as WorldEdit and VoxelSniper, to make the building process easier and faster. You can also visit other plots, rate other builds, and get inspired by other players.

## Events

Events are special occasions where you can participate in fun activities and win awesome prizes. We try to make weekly Bedwars/Uhc/Pvp related events, as well as some survival special events to ensure more engaging competitive experiences.
