# Minecraft Feature Update: Chicken Rescue

Have you ever worried about your loyal wolf companion getting hurt from falling off cliffs, towers, or other high places? Well, worry no more! In this feature update, we introduce a new mechanic that will save your furry friend from any fall damage: **Chicken Rescue**!

## How it works

Whenever your wolf falls from a height that would normally cause damage, a chicken will magically appear and catch your wolf in mid-air. The chicken will then gently float down to the ground, bringing your wolf back to you safely and soundly.

## Why we added this feature

We wanted to add some more fun and whimsy to the game, for the players who care about their pets. We know how much you love your wolves, and we don't want you to lose them to accidental falls. With this feature, you can explore the world with your wolf without any fear of losing them.

We hope you enjoy this feature update and have fun with your wolves and chickens. Happy Minecrafting! ðŸ˜Š.
